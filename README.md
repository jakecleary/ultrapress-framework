# Not just another Wordpress theme

## What?

**UltraPress:** a theme boilerplate that utilizes the MVC pattern to bring structure and sanity to Wordpress development.

**Note:** for the library that supports UltraPress, see [jakecleary/ultrapress-library](https://github.com/jakecleary/ultrapress-library/).

**Early in development. All ideas, features, and documentation subject to change.**

## Why?

Wordpress sucks, but a lot of developers have to work with it for various reasons outside of their control, so I decided to try and make it suck a little less.

## How

1. [Download Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/latest.zip) and copy it into your project folder.
2. `$ cd wp-content/themes/`
3. `$ composer create-project jakecleary/ultrapress your-theme-name`
4. `$ cd your-theme-name`
5. `$ sudo npm install`
6. Check out the documentation (**coming soon**) to learn how to write more efficient Wordpress themes.
